I've upgraded from Ubuntu 16.10 to 18.04. Despite of error messages during the  
installation and replacement of the packages, after reboot everything works.

The clock indicator is stupid. Where are my watches for different cities? Why is it not   
configurable through the right click? I miss the sound inicator ability to show  
plugging a headphone. Overall, the Ubuntu interface was better, than the Gnome.
