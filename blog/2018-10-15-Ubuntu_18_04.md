I've upgraded from the Ubuntu 16.10 to 18.04. Despite of error messages during the  
installation and replacement of the packages, after reboot all work.

The clock indicator is stupid. Where is my clocks for various cities? Why it's not   
configurable through the right click? I miss of sound inicator ability to show  
plugging a headphone. Overall, the Ubuntu interface was better, than the Gnome.
