# How to create a Live SSD hard drive with Ubuntu.

I have an old SSD drive for 16 Gb and a shared computer on the job. I want to come,
 connect it as additional SATA drive, boot to Ubuntu, work, save the results and get it
back to home when the day is finished. The main drive on the computer has a Windows
 installed there and I don't want mess with it. So the task was to create a bootable
drive that could be seen by UEFI bootloader. The insruction to do this is following:

1. Download the Ubuntu install image. These days it is `ubuntu-18.04-desktop-am64.iso`.
2. Create a bootable flash drive
`dd if=ubuntu*-am64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M status=progress` (`/dev/sdb` is a device-name
 for the flash drive).
3. Insert the flash into USB, connect SSD to SATA, and say the bootloader on the target
 comp to boot from our flash.
4. Run `GParted` and create on the SSD drive a GPT partitional table. Then create 2 primary
 partitions there. The first as big as possible, type EXT4, for the Ubuntu and the second,
 small, 200 Mb in size, type FAT32, for the boot files. The second also make bootable.
5. Run Ubuntu installation and choice 'Custom' mode when it asks about a place to install.
I've also choosen a 'Minimal' installation, but it's optional.
6. Choice the biggest partion (`/dev/sda1` in my case) as the `root` mount point.
7. Say install boot files into the small one (`/dev/sda2`).

After finishing you'll have an UEFI compatable SSD drive.
